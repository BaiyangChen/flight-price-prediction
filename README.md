# Flight Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices using Python and scikit-learn. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, and result evaluation.

## Project Description

In this project, I applied various data processing techniques and built predictive models to estimate the price of flight tickets based on multiple factors such as departure time, arrival time, airline, total stops, and travel duration.

The project workflow includes:

- Data cleaning (handling missing values, type conversions)
- Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables, extracting datetime features)
- Model training using multiple regression algorithms
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores
- Visualization of prediction results

## Technologies Used
